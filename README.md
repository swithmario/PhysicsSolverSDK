# PhysicsSolverSDK: AI-Accelerated Modular Physics Simulation

COMPATIBLE WITH [Engine](https://github.com/swithmario/Engine?tab=readme-ov-file)

**Tagline:** *An open-source C++ framework for high-fidelity offline physics simulation, designed to produce data for real-time interactive exploration and AI-driven insights.*

## üöÄ Introduction

The PhysicsSolverSDK is an ambitious, open-source C++ platform designed to simulate complex physical phenomena across various domains‚Äîincluding acoustics, optics, and mechanics. Our primary goal is to generate high-fidelity "ground truth" data from these offline simulations. This data is structured for use in a variety of applications, from scientific research and engineering analysis to powering immersive, real-time interactive experiences.

The core philosophy is **modularity, physical accuracy, and pervasive AI integration**. This SDK is being built from the ground up to leverage modern C++, parallel computing, and AI techniques to tackle challenging simulations.

**Relationship with Real-Time Exploration:**

While this repository focuses on the **PhysicsSolverSDK** (the offline data generator), the vision includes a complementary **Real-Time Exploration Engine** (likely a separate project/application) that would consume the SDK's output.

This SDK provides the "Offline Scientist"; the Real-Time Engine acts as the "Experiential Stage Manager."

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities (Envisioned for Full SDK)

The PhysicsSolverSDK aims to provide a library of interconnected modules:

* **Multi-Domain Physics Solvers:**

  * **Acoustics:** Wave-based (FDTD, FEM) and geometric methods for sound propagation, reflection, diffraction, and material interaction.

    * *Output Example:* Frequency-dependent impulse responses, spherical harmonic coefficients at probe locations.
  * **Optics (Hyperspectral):** Monte Carlo path tracing (spectral rendering), wave optics for specific phenomena.

    * *Output Example:* Spectral lightmaps, baked light probes (SPDs), NeRF-compatible data.
  * **Mechanics:** Rigid and soft body dynamics (PBD, FEM), advanced collision detection and response.
  * **(Future Domains):** CFD, N-Body systems, granular media.
* **AI-Powered Enhancements (Integrated into Solvers):**

  * **AI Scene Analyst:** Inferring physical material properties (e.g., acoustic impedance from mesh and texture; density from geometric cues) from input scene data (e.g., USD, glTF + images).
  * **AI Surrogate Models:** Using techniques like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to accelerate specific PDE solutions within larger simulations (e.g., approximating acoustic wave propagation in sub-regions).
  * **Learned Data Compression:** Compressing complex output fields (e.g., volumetric data, light fields) for efficient storage and real-time streaming.
* **USD-Centric Data Pipeline:** Leveraging Universal Scene Description (USD) for scene input, physics data parameterization, and structured output of simulation results.
* **Modern C++ & Performance:** Designed for C++20, focusing on data-oriented patterns and parallel execution on multi-core CPUs and GPUs (targeting Vulkan, Metal, CUDA where appropriate).

**Example Application Scenario (Long-Term Vision):**
*Simulating the acoustic and spectral lighting properties of a complex virtual environment (e.g., a concert hall or a training simulation for emergency responders). The SDK would "bake" detailed acoustic responses and spectral light transport. The Real-Time Engine would then allow a user to interactively experience this environment with realistic sound propagation and lighting that adapts to their position and actions.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Current MVP Work & Focus (As of \[Current Date - e.g., June 2025])

The PhysicsSolverSDK is in its **early scaffolding and foundational development phase**.

**Our immediate focus is on prototyping the real-time consumption of *simplified, manually pre-computed* acoustic data.** This work is being done within a separate C++/SDL2-based application (acting as a minimal Real-Time Exploration Engine prototype) to validate the data pipeline concepts:

1. **Core Audio Components:** Defining `AudioSourceComponent`, `AudioListenerComponent`, and an `AudioSystem` in the prototype engine.
2. **Stubbed Acoustic Data:**

   * Manually creating simplified acoustic data (e.g., direct path attenuation dB, basic reverb parameters per frequency band) for a few "audio probe" locations in an L-Hallway test scene.
   * This data is currently embedded directly in C++ structs (previously discussed as JSON, now embedded for MVP simplicity in the engine).
3. **Real-Time Application:** The `AudioSystem` in the prototype engine loads this stubbed data and applies volume/effect changes to a sound source as a listener moves, demonstrating the basic principle of using pre-computed data.

**This MVP work primarily informs the *data contracts* and *runtime requirements* that the future PhysicsSolverSDK's acoustic modules will need to fulfill.** The full FDTD/FEM acoustic solvers within this SDK are not yet implemented.

## üè© Architecture

The PhysicsSolverSDK is built upon a modular, extensible architecture. The core design principles include:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Physics domains (acoustics, optics), core functionalities (math, geometry, I/O), and AI components are distinct modules.
* **Interface-Based Design:** Solvers and other key components will adhere to defined interfaces to promote interchangeability and testing.
* **USD as the Backbone:** USD is planned for scene description input and as a primary format for publishing simulation outputs.

A detailed explanation of the directory structure and architectural principles can be found in our [**Architecture Overview**](./docs/architecture_overview.md) document *(Note: Link to be created)*.

## üóòÔ∏è Roadmap (High-Level)

1. **Phase 1 (Current):**

   * Refine data structures for acoustic probe data (based on MVP learnings).
   * Begin implementation of basic `core` SDK modules (math, scene representation).
   * Develop initial USD import capabilities for simple scene geometry.
   * Design the `AcousticSolverBase` interface.
2. **Phase 2 (Near Future):**

   * Implement a very basic geometric acoustics solver (ray casting) as a first example within the SDK.
   * Prototype the export of its data to a USD-based format.
   * Begin research and design for AI Scene Analyst module.
3. **Phase 3 (Mid Term):**

   * Develop initial FDTD acoustic solver.
   * Begin work on core hyperspectral light transport (e.g., basic path tracer).
   * Integrate initial AI surrogate models for simple cases.

*(This roadmap is provisional and will evolve.)*
