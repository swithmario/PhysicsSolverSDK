# External/Vendor libraries if not managed as submodules
# If 'external' contains libraries you download and build locally but don't want to track,
# you might add 'external/' here. However, if you plan to use Git submodules for them,
# then you wouldn't ignore the 'external' directory itself, just its build products if any.
# For now, let's assume you might add built libs here sometimes:
# external/**/*.a
# external/**/*.lib
# external/**/*.so
# external/**/*.dylib
# external/**/*.dll

# Large data files that shouldn't be in git (if any, beyond sample scenes)
# For example, if your 'data/validation_data' becomes very large with binary files.
# data/validation_data/*.bin
